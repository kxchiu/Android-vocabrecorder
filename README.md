_Mini Warm-up Project_
Memorizing vocabulary words for GRE or any other standardized exams can be rough (which is what I'm currently doing :p), and it's probably not so easy to carry a huge vocabulary packet around. So for this mini warm-up project--to get my hands back on Android App development--I will build an app that allows the user to add their own vocabulary words into the app, with the options to add in the vocabulary details or to look up online.

###Objectives
By completing this challenge I will practice:
* Using fragments to implement a multi-pane Activity
* Dynamically changing displayed fragments
* Managing a history of screens and tasks in an app
* Creating and displaying pop-up dialogs
* Storing and retrieving data using SQLite
* Using intents to communicate between activities and applications
* (Maybe?) Learning and using Android UI widgets and patterns

###User Stories
The user stories for the VocabRecorder App are:
* As a user, I want to be able to add my own vocabulary words with definition
* As a user, I want to be able to see the list of added vocabs
* As a user, I want to be able to view a summary of my added vocabs to know how many or what type of words I've added
* As a user, I want to be able to filter the list by vocab type (noun, verb, etc.)
* As a user, I want to be able to search up the word in Dictionary.com and Google
* (If possible) As a user, I want to be able to see a randomly picked word of the day when I open the app
